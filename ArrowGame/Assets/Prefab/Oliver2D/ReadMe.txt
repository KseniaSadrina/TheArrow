Hi, and thank you for purchasing my Hunter character. Please look out for more characters and asset packs from me, I plan on releasing a lot more soon. Backgrounds and UI packs will be released to match the fantasy genre as well.

PSDs are not included in these files, and parts are not swappable since they are meshes. I'm working on finding a way to make my meshes swappable, but I'm not there yet! A future update may include this.

As for the Unity Package, I hope that it is straightforward. This pack does include an optional helmet, which can be found under Parts > Head. This is swappable with the hair, it is not made to go over the hair. 

As you can see, some of the animations include a change of expression with in them, but feel free to change these to whatever you'd like. The more popular a character is, the more likely I am to release additional skins in future updates.

Please feel free to reach out and let me know if you like this character, or what other type of assets would be most helpful to you in the future.

If you have any questions or requests for future packs, please email me at Artbykandles@gmail.com 

Thank you again! Please enjoy! :)
